The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position.

When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.\n\n| Playing Card      | Illusion                         |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Ace of hearts     | Red dragon                       |\n| King of hearts    | Knight and four guards           |\n| Queen of hearts   | Succubus or incubus              |\n| Jack of hearts    | Druid                            |\n| Ten of hearts     | Cloud giant                      |\n| Nine of hearts    | Ettin                            |\n| Eight of hearts   | Bugbear                          |\n| Two of hearts     | Goblin                           |\n| Ace of diamonds   | Beholder                         |\n| King of diamonds  | Archmage and mage apprentice     |\n| Queen of diamonds | Night hag                        |\n| Jack of diamonds  | Assassin                         |\n| Ten of diamonds   | Fire giant                       |\n| Nine of diamonds  | Ogre mage                        |\n| Eight of diamonds | Gnoll                            |\n| Two of diamonds   | Kobold                           |\n| Ace of spades     | Lich                             |\n| King of spades    | Priest and two acolytes          |\n| Queen of spades   | Medusa                           |\n| Jack of spades    | Veteran                          |\n| Ten of spades     | Frost giant                      |\n| Nine of spades    | Troll                            |\n| Eight of spades   | Hobgoblin                        |\n| Two of spades     | Goblin                           |\n| Ace of clubs      | Iron golem                       |\n| King of clubs     | Bandit captain and three bandits |\n| Queen of clubs    | Erinyes                          |\n| Jack of clubs     | Berserker                        |\n| Ten of clubs      | Hill giant                       |\n| Nine of clubs     | Ogre                             |\n| Eight of clubs    | Orc                              |\n| Two of clubs      | Kobold                           |\n| Jokers (2)        | You (the deck's owner)           |",

            "desc": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\n| Playing Card       | Card        |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Ace of diamonds    | Vizier\\*    |\n| King of diamonds   | Sun         |\n| Queen of diamonds  | Moon        |\n| Jack of diamonds   | Star        |\n| Two of diamonds    | Comet\\*     |\n| Ace of hearts      | The Fates\\* |\n| King of hearts     | Throne      |\n| Queen of hearts    | Key         |\n| Jack of hearts     | Knight      |\n| Two of hearts      | Gem\\*       |\n| Ace of clubs       | Talons\\*    |\n| King of clubs      | The Void    |\n| Queen of clubs     | Flames      |\n| Jack of clubs      | Skull       |\n| Two of clubs       | Idiot\\*     |\n| Ace of spades      | Donjon\\*    |\n| King of spades     | Ruin        |\n| Queen of spades    | Euryale     |\n| Jack of spades     | Rogue       |\n| Two of spades      | Balance\\*   |\n| Joker (with TM)    | Fool\\*      |\n| Joker (without TM) | Jester      |\n\n\\*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\n\n**_Balance_**. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n**_Comet_**. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n#",
